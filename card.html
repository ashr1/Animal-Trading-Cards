			<p class="italicText">Lions are very social compared to other cat species, often living in prides that feature females, offspring and a few adult males.</p>
			<ul class="italicText factList">

			<p>Lions are the laziest of the big cats. They usually spend 16 to 20 hours a day sleeping and resting, devoting the remaining hours to hunting,
				 courting or protecting their territory. They keep in contact with one another by roaring loud enough to be heard up to five miles away.</p>
